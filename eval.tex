\section{Evaluation}\label{s:eval}

%We have seen in Figure~\ref{fig:design:shift-bottleneck} that \name can move the network queues to the \inbox to gain control over scheduling. 
%Given that this is possible, what benefits can \name achieve, and where do they come from?
Given \name's ability to move the in-network queues to the \inbox (as shown earlier in Figure~\ref{fig:design:shift-bottleneck}), we now explore:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt]
    \item Where do \name's performance benefits come from? We discuss this in the context of improving the flow completion times of \name's component flows. (\S\ref{s:eval:fct})
    \item Can \name enforce different scheduling policies? (\S\ref{s:eval:policies})
    \item Do \name's performance benefits hold across different scenarios? (\S\ref{s:robust:cross})
    %\item Under what conditions do \name's performance benefits hold? (\S\ref{s:robust:cross})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}\label{s:eval:setup}

We use network emulation via mahimahi~\cite{mahimahi} to extensively evaluate our implementation of \name in a controlled setting; we also present results on real Internet paths in \S\ref{s:eval:realworld}.
%Mahimahi creates a Linux network namespace and applies the configured network condition (emulated delay or link bandwidth) to all packets that traverse it. 
There are three $8$-core machines in our emulated setup: one machine is a sender, another is configured as a middlebox and runs \inbox, and a third is the receiver. The \outbox runs on the same machine as the receiver, inside the same mahimahi network namespace as the receiving application. 
%Our prototype requires that the sending application and the \inbox run on different machines, to prevent TCP small queues (TSQ) from interfering with the queuing behaviour that one would expect in a real deployment. 
Since our \outbox implementation uses \texttt{libpcap}, GRO would change the packets before they are delivered to the \outbox, which would cause inconsistent epoch boundary identification between the two boxes. We, therefore, disable TSO and GRO.
Nevertheless, throughout our experiments CPU utilization on the machines remained below $10$\%.

Unless otherwise specified, we emulate the following scenario.
A many-threaded client generates requests from a request size CDF drawn from an Internet core router~\cite{caida-dataset}, and assigns them to one of $200$ server processes on the traffic generator.
The workload is heavy-tailed: 97.6\% of requests are 10KB or shorter, and the largest 0.002\% of requests are between $5$MB and $100$MB.
Each server then sends the requested amount of data to the client and we measure the flow completion time of each such request. 
The link bandwidth at the mahimahi link is set to 96Mbps, and the RTT is set to 50ms. The requests result in an offered load of 84Mbps. 

The endhost runs Cubic~\cite{cubic}, and the \inbox runs Copa~\cite{copa} (we test other schemes in \S\ref{s:eval:cc}) with the Nimbus~\cite{nimbus} cross traffic detection mechanism. The \inbox schedules traffic using stochastic fair queueing~\cite{sfq} in our experiments by default (we show other policies in \S\ref{s:eval:policies}). 
Each experiment is comprised of 1,000,000 requests sampled from this distribution, across 10 runs each with a different random seed.

\subsection{Understanding Performance Benefits}\label{s:eval:fct}

We first present results for a simplified scenario without any cross-traffic, \ie all traffic traversing through the network is generated by the same customer and is, therefore, part of the same bundle. 
This scenario highlights the benefits of using \name when the congestion on the bottleneck link in the network is self-inflicted. We explore the effects of congestion due to other cross-traffic in \S\ref{s:robust:cross}.

\input{overview-benefits}
\newcommand{\baseline}{Status Quo\xspace}
\newcommand{\optimal}{In-Network\xspace}

\Para{Using \name for fair queueing}
In this section, we evaluate the benefits provided by doing fair queuing at the \name, and use median slowdown as our metric, where the ``slowdown'' of a request is its completion time divided by what its completion time would have been in an unloaded network. A slowdown of $1$ is optimal, and lower numbers represent better performance.

We evaluate three configurations: 
(i) The ``\baseline'' configuration represents the status quo: the \inbox simply forwards packets as it receives them, and the mahimahi bottleneck uses FIFO scheduling.
(ii) The ``\optimal'' configuration deploys fair queueing
at the mahimahi bottleneck\footnote{
We implement this scheme by modifying mahimahi (our patch comprises $171$ lines of C++) to add a packet-level fair-queueing scheduler to the bottleneck link.}. 
Recall from \S\ref{s:intro} that this configuration is not deployable.
%: it would force all customers --- who may desire diverging scheduling policies --- to use the same scheduler.
(iii) The default \name configuration, that uses stochastic fair queueing~\cite{sfq} scheduling policy at the \inbox, and (iv) Using \name with FIFO (without exploiting scheduling opportunity).
%\radhika{flip the order for in-network and \name in the figure to be consistent with the above order.}

Figure~\ref{fig:eval:best} presents our results. 
The median slowdown (across all flow sizes) decreases from \overviewBenefitsBaselineMedian 
for Baseline to \overviewBenefitsBundlerMedian 
with \name, \overviewBenefitsBundlerMedianImprovement
lower. 
\optimal's median slowdown is a further 15\% lower then \name: \overviewBenefitsOptimalMedian.
Meanwhile, in the tail, \name's $99\%$ile slowdown is \overviewBenefitsBundlerTail, which is 48\% lower than the \baseline's \overviewBenefitsBaselineTail. \optimal's $99\%$ile slowdown is \overviewBenefitsOptimalTail.

\paragrapha{Aggregate congestion control is not enough} It is important to note that \name's congestion control by itself (i.e. running FIFO scheduling) is not a means of achieving improved performance. 
To see why this is the case, recall that \name does not modify the endhosts: they continue to run the default Cubic congestion controller, which will probe for bandwidth until it observes loss.
Indeed, the packets endhost Cubic sends beyond those that the link can transmit must queue somewhere in the network or get dropped. 
Without \name, they queue at the bottleneck link;
with \name, they instead queue at the \inbox. 
In addition, the delay-based congestion controller at \inbox also maintains a small standing queue at the bottleneck link (which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:design:shift-bottleneck}) to avoid under-utilization, which increases the end-to-end-delays slightly. 
Therefore, doing the FIFO scheduling at the \name, as is done by the \baseline, results in slightly worse performance.

\subsection{Real Internet Paths}\label{s:eval:realworld}
\input{realworld}

\radhika{will do a pass on this subsection. Purpose, expt setup, and takeaways are not coming across as sharply. Might need a quick chat.}

Is there queueing on real Internet paths, and if so, can \name effectively control those queues?
An interesting real-Internet scenario to consider is load-balancing, a widely used technique for reducing the congestion on any one path.
Here, we make two observations: 
(1) while bundle traffic may traverse multiple intermediate paths, it will converge on the receiving domain (and the \outbox). If the bottleneck is near the receiving domain, the bundled traffic will still build queues.
(2) from the bundle's perspective, multiple paths appear as multiple queues, with some aggregate bandwidth capacity (\ie the max-flow of the network paths between the sending and receiving domains). While queueing may be unevenly distributed among the paths, the distribution of flows onto paths is currently random (\eg via ECMP). With \name, all these queues are moved to the \inbox, so it can schedule bundled flows deliberately rather than randomly.

To measure this effect, we measure the latency of 10 parallel, closed-loop UDP senders with 40-byte requests. Each UDP sender uses a different port, to gain visibility across multiple paths, if applicable.
We gather baseline latency measurements on five bundles sent from a GCP datacenter in Iowa to GCP datacenters in Belgium, Frankfurt, Oregon, South Carolina, and Tokyo and measure queueing\footnote{We use GCP's ``Standard Networking'' option, since our focus is the public Internet.}
by comparing this baseline to the same scenario with 20 backlogged senders.
In all cases, we verified that the backlogged senders achieve similar throughput (2-4Gbit/s on these paths) with and without \name.
Figure~\ref{fig:eval:realworld} shows one set of box-plots for each 5-tuple, for each of the five bundles. ``Base RTT'' bars show the latency without backlogged senders and ``Status Quo'' bars represent, as above, the latency with the backlogged senders but without \name.
We observe multipath effects for all five bundles; while, as a result, some paths experience no queueing, all five bundles also experience queueing on at least half of the available paths.

On the paths with queueing, because \name can prioritize the latency-sensitive requests, the latency those requests observe is significantly reduced. As a result, across the bundle as a whole, \name achieves \realworldMedianLatencyImprovement lower latencies than the status quo scenario over the 5 paths.

\begin{Appendix}
\section{Varying Offered Load}\label{s:eval:offeredload}
%Naturally, if a link is less congested, scheduling the packets that traverse it will have less benefit. Accordingly, as the offered load is reduced, we would expect the gains from scheduling to diminish. 
We now use the web request distribution described in \S\ref{s:eval:setup} to generate a load of 50\% ($48$Mbps), 75\% ($72$Mbps) and 87.5\% ($84$Mbps) of the bottleneck link bandwidth. Our results in Figure~\ref{fig:eval:offeredload} show that as the offered load is decreased, the benefits of \name reduce. This is because if a link is less congested, scheduling the packets that traverse it will have less benefit.
% At 87.5\% load, even without the load offered by a persistently backlogged connection, \name improves FCTs by \an{amount}. 
% As the offered load decreases to 50\%, the benefit provided by \name decreases as well -- to \an{amount} at the 75th percentile.

\input{varying-offered-load}
\end{Appendix}

\subsection{Applying Different Scheduling Policies}\label{s:eval:policies}
%Per \S\ref{s:impl}, our \name implementation can implement any scheduling discipline available in Linux. 
We demonstrate that, in addition to improving flow completion times, our implementation of \name can achieve low packet delay, perform strict prioritization, and rate fairness.

\paragrapha{Achieving Improved Flow Completion Times} \S\ref{s:eval:fct} shows how enabling SFQ at the \name improves the median slowdown by \overviewBenefitsBundlerMedianImprovement.

\paragrapha{Achieving Low Packet Delays}
We enable CoDel~\cite{fq-codel} at the \inbox to lower the packet delays, and test it for a single large backlogged flow using the setup described in \S\ref{s:eval}.
CoDel adds ECN marks to packets in fair-queue buckets which exceed a queue length threshold. 
As a result, endhosts cut their windows earlier, thus reducing their self-inflicted delay within their fair-queue bucket.
We measure the resulting distribution of RTTs seen by the endhost connections with \name and \baseline in Table~\ref{t:eval:codel}.
\input{lowdelays}
As is expected from CoDel, \name in this experiment, achieves \delaysImprovement lower median packet delay than \baseline.

\paragrapha{Strict Prioritization}\label{s:eval:strictprio}
We uniformly divide the web request distribution described in \S\ref{s:eval:setup} into two equally sized classes, one of which is given a higher priority over the other. \radhika{what's the division ratio?}\an{specified equal ratio}  The results are presented in Table~\ref{t:eval:prio}.
%of traffic transitting \name over a lower-priority class. 
\input{strict-prio}
Using a priority scheduler (we use the \texttt{pfifo\_fast} qdisc) at \inbox improves the flow completion times for the higher-priority class compared to \baseline.
Furthermore, prioritization achieves \strictPrioTailImprovementOverFq lower $99$\%ile FCT for the higher priority traffic class, when compared to using fair queueing.

\input{waterfall}
\paragrapha{Rate Fairness and Stability}\label{s:eval:waterfall}
We next use our default SFQ scheduler to achieve fairness and rate stability. We start three backlogged flows at different times (0s, 15s, and 30s). Figure~\ref{fig:eval:waterfall} shows that \name converges to fair and stable rates faster than the \baseline.

\cut{
\input{video-exp}
\paragrapha{Rate Stability}\label{s:eval:ratestable}
\fc{come back to this}
In Figure~\ref{fig:eval:video}, we run a persistently backlogged flow over a 24Mbps link and then
after 3 seconds start a client attempting to stream a 4k video from a server that supports adaptive
bitrate selection. Without \name (a), the video stream experiences highly variable throughput and 
takes 30 seconds to converge to a fair share of the link. In contrast, with \name (b), the video
stream converges to its fair share within 2 seconds and is able to maintain that rate for the
entirety of the stream. This stability provides the best scenario for the ABR algorithm to select
the highest possible bitrate and thus maximize QoE.

\subsection{Terminating TCP Connections}\label{s:eval:proxy}

Although our \name prototype does not terminate connections (as discussed in \S\ref{s:design:whichcc}), we note that terminating connections, despite its numerous disadvantages, does provide one key advantage: enabling the end-to-end congestion controller to observe a smaller RTT, by acknowledging its segments much faster than the original receiver further away. 
This enables rapid window growth at the endhosts, causing packets to arrive at a faster rate at the middlebox.
While there are, of course, operational concerns with managing the resulting queue, it does provide additional scheduling opportunities as well as faster ramp-up for midsized connections.

How much benefit, then, could a proxy-based \name provide?
To evaluate this, we emulate an idealized TCP proxy by modifying the endhosts to maintain a constant congestion window of $450$ packets---slightly larger than the bandwidth-delay product in our setup---and correspondingly increasing the buffering at the \inbox to hold these packets. 
The other aspects of \name remain unchanged.
The result is in Figure~\ref{fig:eval:proxy}. 

For the short requests which never leave TCP slow start, terminating TCP connections does not yield additional benefits: with or without termination, they finish in a few RTTs.
For medium-to-long requests, terminating TCP connections yields additional benefits since they no longer incur the penalty of window growth.
Therefore, a domain benefit from proxying TCP connections at \name if the traffic pattern contains many medium-sized flows which benefit from fast ramp-up.
