\section{Related Work}
\label{s:related}

%With our work sitting at the intersection of highly popular topics of scheduling, congestion control and middleboxes, one can produce a large body of past work related to each topic. However, this unique intersection of topics is also what adds significant novelty to our work. 
Our work is at the intersection of congestion control, scheduling, and middleboxes. 
%We identify the most relevant related work in each of these areas below. 

\Para{Aggregating congestion information} A recent proposal~\cite{fivecomps} observes that the majority of today's traffic is owned by a few entities.
This observation implies that there are large bundles in practice, resulting in greater scheduling opportunities within a bundle. Note that the proposal uses its observation to highlight the benefits of sharing information across a given customer's traffic when configuring congestion control algorithms at the endhosts. This is orthogonal to our goal of scheduling such traffic by introducing a middlebox without modifying end hosts.

\Para{Packet scheduling} There have been some recent efforts towards enabling the benefits of packet scheduling. PIFO~\cite{pifo} is a programmable priority queue that can be configured to express different scheduling policies at routers. However, not only does it require changing the in-network routers, but it also suffers from the issue of an ISP's limited visibility into the traffic to choose desired policies (and limited incentives to enforce them). UPS~\cite{ups} allows different scheduling policies to be expressed from the edge via header initialization, but also requires a change to the routers.
%However, since queuing still occurs in the middle of the network, it relies on the customers targeting a common global objective, or on the network operators isolating different customers' traffic, both of which are difficult to realize. 
\name provides a solution that does not require any cooperation from downstream networks in other organizations.

In that spirit, \name is closer to OverQoS~\cite{overqos}. Proposed more than a decade ago, OverQoS aimed to provide QoS benefits in the Internet by aggregating and managing traffic at the nodes of an already-deployed overlay network~\cite{ron}. 
Given the aggregation opportunities today, where a few content providers generate a majority of the Internet traffic~\cite{fivecomps}, we observe that the time for reaping benefits from such designs may have arrived. 
Recent trends enable a simpler and more deployable approach; instead of deploying an overlay network, \name{} proposes deploying a middlebox at the sending and the receiving domains to aggregate sufficient traffic. 
This simplifies the ``rezendezvous'' problem, since \name initializes bundles dynamically (\S\ref{s:design}).
In addition, \name provides a novel mechanism to \emph{move} the in-network queues, and gain the power to schedule the bundled traffic.
