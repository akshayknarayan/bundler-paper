    \caption{Distribution of observed epoch sizes based on the desired epoch size. Suppose we
    need an epoch size of 512. By setting the epoch size to $\frac{1}{4}$ of that and using
    a sliding window over the last 4 epochs, we can achieve the same average epoch size with
    significantly lower variance than if we were to set the epoch size to 512 directly.
