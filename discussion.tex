\paragrapha{Composability} Bundles are naturally \emph{composable}: a subdomain of domain A could deploy its own \name to take control of its fraction of the in-network queues. 

\paragrapha{Scheduling across different bundles at a \inbox} We evaluate benefits of scheduling \emph{within} a bundle. In practice, a given \inbox will see traffic from multiple bundles. Extending different scheduling policies to multiple such bundles can be done trivially.
%Different bundles may have different rates; recent work~\cite{carousel, eifel} has shown it is possible to implement such multi-rate, multi-scheduler datapaths efficiently.

\paragrapha{Rate allocation across different competing bundles} When multiple bundles (belonging to different sending domains) compete at the same bottleneck, \name's congestion control would ensure a fair rate allocation across each of these bundles, irrespective of the amount of traffic in them. It, therefore, provides fairness on per-sending domain basis, as opposed to a per-flow basis, making it more robust to popular end-host strategies such as opening multiple connections to increase bandwidth share.
