\1 Initializing pairing between bundler boxes.
    \2 can be done via static config. if sending and receiving domains owned by same entity.
    \2 large content providers can advertise their \inbox address, to which other local {\outbox}es can connect.
\1 Endhosts running delay-based. 
    \2 key reason: reduced queuing delay. hard to change all endhosts. \name does it for them.
\1 Fair rate allocation across bundles (5 vs 10 flows in resepctive bundles) \radhika{if not already discussed in eval}
\1 dealing with non shared bottleneck \radhika{if not already discussed in eval}
\1 when bottleneck for individual flows is behind the \outbox in receiving domain: we still get benefits from reduced queuing delay. 
\1 New scheduling policies 
    \2 Application-aware \radhika{??}
