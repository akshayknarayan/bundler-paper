\section{Discussion}\label{s:discussion}

\paragrapha{Composability} Bundles are naturally \emph{composable}: a subdomain of domain A could deploy its own \name to take control of its fraction of the in-network queues. \radhika{finally at the right place! but needs more exposition.}
\an{added some exposition below}
For example, a department within an institute may bundle its traffic to a collaborating department, while the parent institute bundles its traffic to a peer institute.
\name may be useful at \emph{both} levels of aggregation, because different amounts of traffic experience bottlenecks in different locations.
An individual user could be bottlenecked on a slow Wi-Fi link. 
This individual's traffic might mix with an institute's department which, as an aggregate, is bottlenecked on the campus's local network.
After another layer of aggregation, the institute's traffic could be bottlenecked on an interdomain link.
At each layer of aggregation, it may be beneficial to control the queues at the respective \name.
Studying this deployment scenario remains future work.

\paragrapha{Scheduling across different bundles at a \inbox} We evaluate benefits of scheduling \emph{within} a bundle. In practice, a given \inbox will see traffic from multiple bundles. Extending different scheduling policies to multiple such bundles can be done trivially.
%Different bundles may have different rates; recent work~\cite{carousel, eifel} has shown it is possible to implement such multi-rate, multi-scheduler datapaths efficiently.

\paragrapha{Rate allocation across different competing bundles} When multiple bundles (belonging to different sending domains) compete at the same bottleneck, \name's congestion control would ensure a fair rate allocation across each of these bundles, irrespective of the amount of traffic in them. It, therefore, provides fairness on per-sending domain basis, as opposed to a per-flow basis, making it more robust to popular end-host strategies such as opening multiple connections to increase bandwidth share.
