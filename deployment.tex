\name provides benefits over status quo, when the following conditions are met:

\Para{Opportunities for bundling traffic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cite venkat's hotnets and Labovitz paper (any other citations?)
\end{itemize}

\Para{Bottleneck in the middle of the network}
Can arise due to following:
\paragraphi{When carriers do rate limit}
Find citations
\begin{itemize}
    \item can result in self-inflicted bottlenecks (any citations to show how common this is?).
    \item best case for bundler.
\end{itemize}

\paragraphi{Congestion from other traffic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item short-lived (up to a few MB) cross traffic: we still get benefits.
    \item other bundled traffic: we still get benefits.
    \item long-lived persistent connections: fall back to status quo.
\end{itemize}

\Para{Bottleneck is shared by the bundled traffic}
