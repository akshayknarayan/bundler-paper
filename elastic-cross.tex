    \caption{Varying number of competing buffer-filling cross traffic flows. \name controls a fixed 20 buffer-filling flows in each case. The Y-axis is normalized to the expected fair share of throughput. For example, when there are 40 cross traffic flows, the expected fair share of the bundle is $20 / 60 = 33.3\%$.}
