\caption{(Top) True delay for all packets of \name's component flows based on which of 4 load-balanced paths they traversed (unknown to \name). (Bottom) Delay measurements observed by Bundler, colored based on whether they were derived from an in-order or out-of-order epoch packet. Bundler's measurements cannot distinguish how many paths there are, but the relative number of out-of-order measurements is enough to clearly indicate the presence of multiple RTT-imbalanced paths.}
