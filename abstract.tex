    \cut{Internet content providers can benefit from applying different scheduling and queue management policies to their traffic. 
However, they currently lack control over the queues that build up at the bottleneck links in the network to effectively enforce desired policies. To address this issue, we propose a new kind of middlebox, called \name, which brings the queues in the network under the content provider's control. \name sits at the edge of a sender's domain, and bundles together groups of flows that share a common destination domain. It does rate control for each bundle, such that the queuing induced by its traffic is moved from the bottleneck (wherever it might be in the network) to \name itself. This allows the sender to unilaterally enforce its desired scheduling policy across the bundled traffic. \name has an immediately deployable, light-weight design, which we implement in only $\sim1500$ lines of code. 
Our evaluation, on a variety of emulated scenarios, shows that 
in a scenario with self-inflicted scheduling overhead, \name achieves 33\% lower median slowdown than the status quo.
