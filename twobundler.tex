    \caption{Competing traffic bundles. In both cases, the aggregate offered load is 84Mbps, as in Figure~\ref{fig:eval:best}. For "1:1", we evenly split the offered load between the two Bundles; for "2:1", one bundle has twice the offered load of the other. In both cases, each bundle observes improved median FCT compared to its performance in the baseline scenario.}
